------------------------------------------------

- Contaminants on surface, incorrect cure, or mechanical damage during handling.

Action:
1. Isolate the vehicle and tag with rework code RWK-GEN.
2. Clean the area using approved solvent; perform visual inspection.
3. Sand to remove defect; feather edges to blend.
4. Apply primer (if required) and dry per oven specs.
5. Re-apply topcoat at standard parameters and cure as per spec.
6. Final inspection and sign-off by Quality Engineer.

Control:
- Limit rework queue to X vehicles per shift; escalate beyond threshold.
- Record cycle time added and root cause in RCA register.
